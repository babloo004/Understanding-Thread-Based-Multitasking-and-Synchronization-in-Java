# Multithreading Examples in Java

This repository contains examples of multithreading in Java, demonstrating how to leverage concurrent execution for improved performance and efficiency.

## Bank Account Management

The `BankAccount` class simulates a simple bank account with deposit and withdrawal functionalities. Multiple threads can concurrently deposit and withdraw money from the account, with synchronization mechanisms in place to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.

### Usage

Compile and run the `Main` class to execute the bank account management example:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

## Prime Addition with Multiple Threads

The `PrimeAdditionWithThreads` example calculates the sum of prime numbers within a given range using multiple threads. Each thread computes a portion of the prime numbers and adds them to a shared sum, demonstrating how multithreading can improve performance for compute-intensive tasks.

### Usage

Compile and run the `Main` class to execute the prime addition example:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
